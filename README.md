# Low-cost EEG for Alpha and Beta Wave Monitoring

## Overview
This project demonstrates a low-cost EEG system for monitoring **alpha (8-13 Hz)** and **beta (13-30 Hz)** brain waves. It is designed for educational purposes, providing a hands-on way to learn about **analog and digital filter design** and to study brain activity without the need for expensive medical equipment.
